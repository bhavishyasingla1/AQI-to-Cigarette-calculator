# AQI-to-Cigarette-calculator
This tool calculates the equivalent number of cigarettes smoked based on AQI and exposure duration, helping users understand the health risks of poor air quality. It uses the EPA's formula to convert AQI to PM2.5 concentration and estimates cigarette equivalents using a standard assumption.
